                            The one major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date.
                            localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened
                            in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no
                            expiration. sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as
                            long as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window,
                            this creates a new session and new storage.

                            There's only one Global scope in the JavaScript document. The area outside all the functions
                            is consider the global scope and the variables defined inside the global scope can be
                            accessed and altered in any other scopes.A block scope is the area within if, switch
                            conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it
                            is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the
                            block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.

                            The event loop is what allows javascript to handle thousands and thousands of requests with
                            just a single thread. This architecture allows Javascript and/or Node.js engines to offload
                            operations to the system kernel. To explain it in different terms, the event loop will wait
                            until all blocking/synchronous code is done and then add asynchronous calls into the call
                            stack. This simple architectural approach is what allows javascript to handle way more
                            requests than the traditional multi-threaded synchronous approach.

                            The undefined is a primitive type in JavaScript. So the undefined is a type. And the
                            undefined type has exactly one value that is undefined. When you declare a variable and
                            don’t initialize it to a value, the variable will have a value of undefined. If you access a
                            non-existing property of an object, you’ll get undefined. When you call a function with a
                            number of parameters, you often pass the same number of arguments.A function that doesn’t
                            have a return statement implicitly returns undefined. When you access an array element that
                            is out-of-bounds, you’ll get the undefined value.
